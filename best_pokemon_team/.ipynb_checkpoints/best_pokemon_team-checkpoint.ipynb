    "# Best Pokemon Team EVER\n",

    "When I was younger, I discover the pokemon universe by playing \"Pokemon Diamond\" on Nintendo DS. And before catching a pokemon, I always ask myself : \"Is this pokemon going to make my team stronger ?\". Because your team is limited. You can only have 6 pokemon at max, so you have to choose which pokemon goes on your team carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that time I only choose pokemon who looks strong or had capabilities that I thought were strong. Today I will, once and for all, takle the question **\"What are the best 6 pokemons to have on your team to beat every other player ?\"** by looking at the actual data of the pokemon!"
